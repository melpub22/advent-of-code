# Advent of code solutions

My solutions for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenges


| Year | Language |
|------|----------|
| 2023 | Julia    |

I use these challenges as a way to brush up on my skills or learn new programming languages.

Here are the languages I'd like to complete Advent of Code for at some point:
* Julia (WIP)
* Python
* C
* Fortran
* WASM
